# Minesweeper

A Minesweeper-type game created in JavaScript with jQuery.

One of my first apps ever! You can play it [here](https://robertkirsz-minesweeper.netlify.app/).

`npm install` - installs Gulp and http-server

`npm run watch` - watches for changes in SASS file and compiles it to CSS

`npm run serve` - launches HTTP server
